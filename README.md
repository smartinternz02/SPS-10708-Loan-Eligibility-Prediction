Loans are the core business of banks. The main profit comes directly from the loan’s interest.
The loan companies grant a loan after an intensive process of verification and validation.
However, they still don’t have assurance if the applicant is able to repay the loan with no
difficulties.
Goal of this project is to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on
customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender,
Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History
and others. To automate this process, a problem has been given to identify the
customers segments, those who are eligible for loan amount so that they can be
targeted.
PURPOSE:
The main aim of this use-case is to build a predictive model to predict if an applicant is able to repay
the lending company or not.


REQUIREMENTS:
* ECLIPSE
* WEKA
* LANGUAGE:JAVA


APPLICATIONS:
● Applicable to find whether a customer of bank can get loan or not based on
details of the Applicant.
● Helpful to bank for validating whether the applicant will repay the amount .


CONCLUSION:
● Goal of this project is to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on
customer detail provided while filling online application form.
● The main aim of this use-case is to build a predictive model to predict if an applicant is able to
repay the lending company or not.
● Here using logistic regression we built the prediction model and from we have
evaluated the testing data with good accuracy.
